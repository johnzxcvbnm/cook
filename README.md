<h3>Concept</h3>

<p>The Cooking Epidemic is essentially a collection of recipes which are stored on a database.  The basic functionality of the website will be to house a collection of recipes.  After the user logs in they will be able to upload, edit and delete non-protected recipes.  In the final version they will also be able to leave comments on all recipes along with give them a ranking on their thoughts of a recipe.</p>

My first step is to build a basic website and connect it with a database.  After that I'll create a basic format for the recipes and build the seven restful routes.  The next major build will be to integrate user login and session creation.  The last major leg will be to let the two databases (the recipe collection and the user collection) to interact with each other.
